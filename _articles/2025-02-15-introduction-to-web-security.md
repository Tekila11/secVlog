Web security is fundamental to protecting modern applications. This article covers essential concepts and common vulnerabilities that every security professional should understand.

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting occurs when attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. There are three main types:

### Reflected XSS
```javascript
// Vulnerable code
const userInput = req.query.search;
res.send(`<div>Search results for: ${userInput}</div>`);

// Secure code
const userInput = req.query.search;
res.send(`<div>Search results for: ${escapeHtml(userInput)}</div>`);
```

### Prevention
- Always escape user input
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implement input validation

## 2. SQL Injection

SQL Injection remains one of the most critical web vulnerabilities.

### Example
```sql
-- Vulnerable query
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`;

-- Secure query using prepared statements
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?`;
db.query(query, [username]);
```

## Best Practices

1. Input Validation
   - Validate all user input
   - Use whitelisting over blacklisting
   - Implement proper sanitization

2. Authentication
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement MFA where possible
   - Secure session management

3. Authorization
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Regular permission audits

## Conclusion

Web security is an ongoing process that requires constant vigilance and updates to security measures as new vulnerabilities are discovered.
